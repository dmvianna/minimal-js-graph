# minimal-js-graph

This is a toy full stack implementation of:

- A server that sends (random) data to the client via [Websockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API);
- A client that displays that data in a live chart ([D3](https://d3js.org/)).

Barebones, sure. But it works. Developed for [Node v7.2.1](https://nodejs.org/). Probably won't work in previous versions, as it is coded in [ES6](https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/).

Oh, and make sure you point your browser to **port 3000** of your host!
